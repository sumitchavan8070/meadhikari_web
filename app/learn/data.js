  <h1>Number System</h1>
  <p>The number system is a mathematical notation for representing numbers of a given set using digits or other symbols in a consistent manner. It allows us to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.</p>
  
  <h2>Types of Numbers</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Natural Numbers:</strong> Counting numbers starting from 1. Example: {1, 2, 3, ...}</li>
    <li><strong>Whole Numbers:</strong> Natural numbers along with zero. Example: {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}</li>
    <li><strong>Integers:</strong> Whole numbers along with their negative counterparts. Example: {..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}</li>
    <li><strong>Rational Numbers:</strong> Numbers that can be expressed as the ratio of two integers. Example: 1/2, 3/4, -5/7</li>
    <li><strong>Irrational Numbers:</strong> Numbers that cannot be expressed as the ratio of two integers. Example: √2, π, e</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Binary Number System</h2>
  <p>The binary number system is widely used in computers and digital electronics. It has a base of 2 and uses only two digits: 0 and 1.</p>
  <p>For example, the binary number <code>1011</code> can be converted to decimal as:</p>
  <pre><code>
  1011 = (1 × 2³) + (0 × 2²) + (1 × 2¹) + (1 × 2⁰) = 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 11
  </code></pre>
  
  <h2>Applications of Number Systems</h2>
  <p>Number systems are fundamental to various fields, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Computer Science:</strong> Binary and hexadecimal systems are used in programming, data storage, and networking.</li>
    <li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Octal and hexadecimal systems simplify the representation of large binary numbers.</li>
    <li><strong>Mathematics:</strong> Understanding number systems is essential for solving equations and performing calculations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Grammar Basics</h1>
  <p>Grammar is the set of structural rules governing the composition of sentences in a language. Understanding grammar is essential for effective communication, both written and spoken.</p>
  
  <h2>Parts of Speech</h2>
  <p>Words in English are categorized into different parts of speech based on their function in a sentence. The main parts of speech are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Noun:</strong> A word used to name a person, place, thing, or idea. Example: John, London, book, love.</li>
    <li><strong>Pronoun:</strong> A word used to replace a noun. Example: I, you, he, she, it, we, they.</li>
    <li><strong>Verb:</strong> A word that expresses an action, occurrence, or state of being. Example: run, eat, write, am, is, are.</li>
    <li><strong>Adjective:</strong> A word that describes or modifies a noun. Example: happy, tall, blue.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Sentence Structure</h2>
  <p>Sentences are classified based on their structure and purpose. Here are the main types:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Simple Sentence:</strong> Contains one independent clause. Example: The cat sleeps on the mat.</li>
    <li><strong>Compound Sentence:</strong> Contains two or more independent clauses joined by a conjunction. Example: I wanted to go for a walk, but it started raining.</li>
    <li><strong>Complex Sentence:</strong> Contains one independent clause and at least one dependent clause. Example: Although it was raining, we decided to go out.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Common Grammar Rules</h2>
  <p>Here are some essential grammar rules to keep in mind:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Subject-Verb Agreement:</strong> The subject and verb must agree in number (singular or plural). Example: She runs every morning.</li>
    <li><strong>Tense Consistency:</strong> Maintain consistent verb tenses throughout a sentence or paragraph. Example: Incorrect: She went to the store and buys groceries. Correct: She went to the store and bought groceries.</li>
  </ul>
